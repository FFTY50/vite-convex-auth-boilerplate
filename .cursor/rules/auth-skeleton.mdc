# Mission: Auth Skeleton (Reusable)

Goal: Scaffold authentication and routing in a Vite + React + TS SPA using Convex Auth.

Auth requirements
- Use Convex Auth per docs.
- App is wrapped with ConvexAuthProvider in `src/main.tsx`.
- Provide `ProtectedRoute` (or ProtectedLayout) that:
  - redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
  - preserves the intended destination (return-to behavior)

Routes/pages (general)
- Public:
  - `/login`
  - `/sign-up` (only if password/email auth is enabled)
  - `/forgot-password` (only if password reset is supported)
- Protected:
  - `/app` (or `/dashboard`) as the default protected landing page

Login UX requirements (password flows)
- Password field includes show/hide toggle.
- Basic validation messaging (empty email/password).
- Accessible labels + aria attributes.

Implementation notes
- Keep styling minimal/vanilla (Tailwind + shadcn primitives ok).
- No app-specific routes in this rule; those go in per-project mission prompts.

Output
- List files changed/added and ensure `npm run dev` runs.

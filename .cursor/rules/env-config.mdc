Generate the complete contents of `.cursor/rules/env-config.mdc`.

Scope: Applies to `.env*`, `vite.config.ts`, and `src/lib/**`.

Rules must enforce:
- All service URLs come from environment variables.
- Use `VITE_CONVEX_URL` for Convex client configuration.
- Presence of `src/lib/env.ts` for env validation and typed exports.
- A minimal `.env.example`.
- No hardcoded secrets or URLs.

Include a short checklist for env-related tasks.

Output only the markdown content of the rule file.

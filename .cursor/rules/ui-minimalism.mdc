Generate the complete contents of `.cursor/rules/ui-minimalism.mdc`.

Scope: Apply Intelligently.

Rules must enforce:
- Minimal, non-opinionated UI scaffolding only.
- No custom themes, dashboards, animations, or visual polish unless explicitly requested.
- Use shadcn/ui primitives and basic Tailwind utilities only.
- Basic accessibility requirements (labels, aria attributes, focus states).
- Deferral of all design systems and visual decisions.

Output only the markdown content of the rule file.
